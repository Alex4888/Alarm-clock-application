# Alarm-clock-application
alarm clock application in Python
This program prompts the user to set the alarm time in hours, minutes, and seconds, and then waits until the current time matches the alarm time. Once the alarm time is reached, the program plays a sound file and exits. You'll need to replace the alarm_sound.mp3 file with your own alarm sound file.
